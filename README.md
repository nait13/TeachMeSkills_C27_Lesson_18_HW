<h4>Task1:</h4> The program creates a collection of the ArrayList class and fills it with random elements of type Integer.
Using Streams:
- Remove duplicates
- Print all even elements in the range from 7 to 17 (inclusive)
- Each element multiplied by 2
- Sort and display the first 4 elements
- Display the number of elements in the stream
- Display the arithmetic mean of all numbers in the stream
<ul>
  <li>In the Runner class, the main method calls methods for working with Stream.</li>
  <li>The Service class contains methods for working with Stream.
  <ul>
    <li>The inputArray method will populate the list with random integers.</li>
    <li>The removingDuplicates method removes duplicates.</li>
    <li>The utputElements method outputs all even elements in the range from 7 to 17 (inclusive).</li>
    <li>The multiplicationElements method multiplies each element by 2.</li>
    <li>The sortingElements method sorts and displays the first 4 elements.</li>
    <li>The amountElements method displays the number of elements in the stream.</li>
    <li>The average method displays the arithmetic average of all numbers in the stream</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Task2:</h4> The program creates a collection of the ArrayList class with the values of the names of all students in the group
Using Streams:
- Select all names starting with "a" (regardless of upper/lower case letters)
- Sort and return the first element of the collection
<ul>
  <li>The Runner class in the main method calls the service method to process the list.</li>
  <li>The Service class consists of a service method that processes the file. The selectionNames method selects all names starting with "a" (regardless of upper/lower case letters). The listSorting method sorts and displays the first element of the collection.</li>
  <li>The C27onlGroup interface contains the path to the group list file.</li>
</ul>
